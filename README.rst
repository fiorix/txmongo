About
=====
An asynchronous Python driver for the Mongo database, based on Twisted.
The ``txmongo`` package is an alternative to the original ``pymongo``
shipped with the Mongo database.

Because the original ``pymongo`` package has it's own connection pool and
blocking low-level socket operations, it is hard to fully implement
network servers using the Twisted framework.
Instead of deferring database operations to threads, now it's possible
to do it asynchronously, as easy as using the original API.

Installation
============
You need `setuptools <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools>`_
in order to get ``txmongo`` installed.
Just run **python setup.py install**

Docs and examples
=================
Generate them with **make docs**. You will need `epydoc` installed.
There are some examples in the *examples/* directory.

Hacking
=======
Run **make env** to create clean hacking environment with `virtualenv`.
Run **make** to torture your code with tests and code style tools.
